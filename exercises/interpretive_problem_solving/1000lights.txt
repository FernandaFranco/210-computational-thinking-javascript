n switches: 1, 2, 3.. n
n iterations:
1st: toggle multiples of 1 (all switches)
2nd: toggle multiples of 2 (2, 4, 6,...)
3rd: toggle multiples of 3
.
.
nth: toggle multiples of n

output: array of switches that are on (1 is always one of them)

test cases:

lightsOn(5); //[1,4]
lightsOn(3); //[1]
lightsOn(2); //[1]
lightsOn(1); //[1]
lightsOn(0); //[]
lightsOn(100); //[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

data structures:
array of switches state: true or false (on or off);
start with array of n length containing all falses

algorithm:
for each multiplier from 1 to n
map array of switches
transform each switch that is a multiple of current multiplier
end for loop
filter array of switches by which ones are on (true)
return filtered array indices

what is a multiple: n % m === 0
