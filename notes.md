- anonymous function (function expression?)

- closures : functions retain access to variables in its enclosing scope (closure);

- JavaScript's lexical scoping rules

Be able to explain clearly the following topics:

- primitive values, types and type conversions

PRIMITIVE VALUES

there are five of them. They are the most basic values one can think of including undefined, null, boolean, string, and numbers. Primitive values are passed by value

- variable scopes and hoisting

- function declarations, expressions and scopes

- object properties and mutation

arrays are implemented with objects internally. arrays have a length property, which objects do not.

- assignments and comparison

VARIABLE INITIALIZATION AND ASSIGNMENT

A variable initialization and assignment at the same line doesn't have a return value (returns undefined). An assignment (or reassignment) returns the value assigned to the variable.

STRINGS COMPARISON

Recall that strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values.

- pure functions and side effects
