Understand the problem: specific and explicit set of definitions and rules

- input
- output
- definitions and rules
-- How would you explain to a non-technical person the rules?
-- Are there key concepts that need to be more clearly defined?
-- Are there implied rules that need to be made explicit?


Example: Comparing two version numbers

- two strings containing digits and dots
- compare first digits before first dots
- if digit from version1 is greater than digit from version2, version1 is newer
- if it is smaller, it is older
- if it is the same, we need to compare the next set of digits before the next dot
- the reasoning is the same
- if at the end of the string we can't determine if version1 is newer or not, it means that both versions are equal

Example: Write a function called doubler that doubles every value in an array

input: array of numbers, strings and other types
output: array with numbers multiplied by 2, strings repeated twice, and other types duplicated in the array

questions to define requirements:
- how to deal with empty arrays? return an empty array
- what if array contains invalid element? every type is valid


doubler([1, 2, 3]); // returns [2, 4, 6]
doubler(['goal', 'score', 'music']); // returns ['goalgoal', 'scorescore', 'musicmusic']
doubler(-10); // returns 'Invalid input'
