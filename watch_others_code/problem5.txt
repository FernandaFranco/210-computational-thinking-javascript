encoding:
input: sentence to encrypt as a string, number of rails as integer (n)
output: encrypted string
steps: remove spaces/non words

algorithm:
create n arrays, initialize it containing the chars at indexes 0, 1, 2.. n-1 respectively
each array will be a rail of the fence
first array: add chars at every n + 2 indexes;
second array: add chars at every n indexes;
third array: add chars at every n - 2 indexes;
concat arrays in order;
join array into string
return string

decoding:
input: encrypted string, number of rails as integer
output: original message as string (minus spaces);
steps: look at pattern
fill first rail
fill second rail
fill third rail
read words in zigzag format
