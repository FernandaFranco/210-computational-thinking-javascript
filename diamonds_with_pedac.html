      // input: odd integer n
      // output: print out diamond in a n x n grid
      // requirements: takes an odd positive number starting from 1, and creates a grid with rows and columns with the length of both being the number. Use a * to create a diamond shape;
      // rules: starts and ends with a single * at the middle of first row
      // at the middle row, full row length is *;
      // the problem requires a loop to console log strings containing the appropriate sequence of spaces and * to form a diamond. starts with one * and the rest of the n length as spaces surrounding. amount of * grow to the next odd number and amount of spaces decrease, until the middle row contains only *. it then starts to decrease to the lowest odd number until a single * is printed;
      // data structure: string for rows
      // algorithm: given an argument n, while row count is smaller than n, print a row made of (n - starsCount)/2 spaces, starsCount stars, and (n - starsCount)/2 spaces
